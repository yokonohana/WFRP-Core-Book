This chapter shows you how to make your own Character from scratch. Most begin the game as unremarkable inhabitants of the Empire — possibly destined for greatness, but no-one would guess it. That’s not to say you can’t rise from humble origins, just that you’ve got a long journey ahead, and that you’ll probably need a better pair of boots. </p><p>All the information describing your Character’s abilities is recorded on a Character Sheet. We provide ready-made Characters and sheets in the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>, and online at cubicle7.co.uk. Using ready-made Characters is a great way to start playing and find out how the game works, but sooner or later you’ll want to create your own from the ground up.</p><p>When deciding what your Character will be like, discuss the kind of group you want to create with the other players. This makes sure that the group’s Characters complement each other and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of abilities. Your GM may also have a particular kind of game in mind, and you’ll need to make sure you have the right mix of Characters. Perhaps the GM plans for you to join a group of apprentice wizards who know one another at the Colleges of Magic? Maybe you are part of a unit of soldiers who have all deserted? Or maybe you are one of a disparate band of Reiklanders press-ganged into service by a powerful noble? Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character which will be more fun to play.</p><h3>Creating a Character</h3><p>In some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the result of a dice roll to make the choice for you. You may receive bonus Experience Points (XP) for choosing to accept random outcomes, as if the Dark Gods of Chaos themselves applaud your acceptance of random chance. XP represent learning from experience and are the principal way to improve your abilities — you will be able to spend these points to enhance your character’s abilities. XP are covered in more detail in @UUID[.e5PQEbXYkH14z525]{Career Advancement}. </p>",

From the plains of the Estalian Kingdoms to the frozen oblasts of Imperial Kislev, Humans occupy every corner of the continent, and they thrive. The largest, most powerful Human realm is the Empire, a patchwork of powerful provinces blanketed in seemingly endless forests. Standing proud at the heart of this Empire, the Reikland is its richest, most cosmopolitan region.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/witch-hunter.webp\" width=\"345\" height=\"493\" /></div>\n<p>Many Reiklanders see it as their divine right to rule, for the patron god of the Empire, Sigmar, was himself a Reiklander before he ascended to godhood many centuries ago. Temples and shrines to the god are found everywhere, and the majority of Reiklanders are devout believers in Sigmar’s message of Empire and unity. Because of this, they are significantly more friendly, open, and optimistic than other folk, since what could possibly go wrong for a land that birthed a god? By comparison, outsiders often see them as arrogant, over-bearing meddlers who stick their unwanted noses into any affair.</p>\n<p>Beyond their affluent lifestyles and pushy personalities, Reiklanders are largely the same as other Humans. They may be shorter-lived than other species, but Humans possess more vigour, versatility, and ambition. They also have a seemingly inextricable relationship with the insidious horrors of the Ruinous Powers, with more Humans falling to corruption than any other species. Perhaps it’s no surprise the declining elder species grow increasingly concerned the meteoric rise of Humanity could result in cataclysm. </p>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Dwarfs…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘They’ve been our allies since Sigmar walked this very city; fought with them meself back in ’05. Sure, they’re a bit stubborn, seriously vindictive and pretty blunt, but I won’t hear a word said against them.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Reikäger Jungling, State Soldier from Altdorf</p>\n<p><strong>On Halflings…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘If I gets meself the sort wot eats and smokes all day, then I’m happy as Ranald in catnip. It’s when I get them without proper manners nicking me crockery or knives and forks: that I just can’t abide! They’re all smiles and shrugs when the watch come to pick ’em up, like they don’t understand what they done wrong.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Stefan Krause, Innkeeper from Stirgau</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Yes, I do trade with them. And, no, don’t be ridiculous, I’ve never been turned to a pillar of salt just by looking at them. Truly, I find them graceful and urbane. Proper civilised, I’d say. But, ’tween you and me, if Verena were to ask, I might also say I find them just… odd. So very intense. Like every deal we make really matters.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Dorothea Taalenstein, Merchant from Kemperbad</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Elves of the forest you say? Ain’t none of ’em around here, mate. You want to be goin’ south to Bretonnia. I hear they gots loads of them, and that they’re completely horrible!’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Siggina Gerster, Bawd from Ubersreik</p>\n<h3>Dwarfs</h3>\n<p>Dwarfs — or ‘Dawi’ as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff and stubborn. While the majority reside in vast mountainside fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain.</p>\n<p>Dwarf culture respects skill in crafting — chiefly stonework, smithing and engineering — and Dwarf Holds are resplendent with impressive feats of artifice. They also covet gold and jewels, mining deep beneath the mountains in the pursuit of precious metals and gemstones. However, more than these material possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have entire religions focussing upon important progenitors. Dwarfs cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with intricate runes to harness magical power. </p>\n<p>However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are mistaken for magic by simpler folk. </p>\n<p>Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a  fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf ’s friendship, once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down in battle, such is the strength of their conviction.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/artisan.webp\" width=\"353\" height=\"446\" /></div>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Reiklander Humans…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Like my father and my father afore me, I’ve been living in Reikland all me life. As folk go, they know not to mess with my business, and show the respect I deserve, as is right. Yes, they’re unreliable, and as changeable as the wind, but they’re also resourceful and shrewd, so I’d recommend them as risky business partners, as they see solutions I’d not even consider.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Garral Herraksson, Jeweller from Eilhart</p>\n<p><strong>On Halflings…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘They’re just not my kind of folk. Always smiling. Always fidgeting. Always talking. Always moving in big groups that just won’t shut up! When they come in my store, I like to shoo them off with a broom. Really, what have they got to be so happy about? I just don’t trust them.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Helgi Galannasniz, Burgher from Schrabwald</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Don’t talk to me about those bloody bastards! Alrug Skycaster, my ultimate granduncle, was bloody betrayed in the bloody War of bloody Vengeance by those… those… ARGH! It’s our clan’s oldest grudge! Stood for thousands of bloody years! When I find the descendants of bloody Galanthiel Whisperthorn, by Grungni! I’m going to teach them all — every single last one of them — a lesson in manners with my axe!’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Snorrt Leivvusson, Diplomat from Karak Ziflin</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves…</strong></p>\n<p>‘<em>My great grandfather thought logging forests on t’other side of the Grey Mountains would be lucrative. Ignored all the warnings, he was sure he was onto a winner. What could a bunch of skinny Elves do to him and his lads, after all? A lot, as it turned out. Only my grandfather survived, left alive to spread the message: “Keep away.” So, me and my lads are preparing a party to take revenge.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Merig Ranvigsdottir, Villager from Azorn-Kalaki</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"> </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Animosity (Elves)</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Given the long memories of Dwarfs and their tendency to bear grudges, many harbour a deep resentment towards Elves for their part in the War of Vengeance. As such, many Dwarfs have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Q2MCUrG2HppMcvN0]{Animosity (Elves)} Psychology trait. Given some WFRP parties contain both Elves and Dwarfs, this may lead to unhelpful tensions. So, you may prefer to ignore this Talent between party members..</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Halflings</h3>\n<p>Halflings are ubiquitous across the Reikland, found working in service industries in all towns, with an entire district of Reikland’s capital of Altdorf, known as Haffenstadt, packed tight with hundreds of extended Halfling families supporting restaurants, taverns, pipeweed stores, and an enormous number of street-food hawkers. Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland’s villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space.</p>\n<p>Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage, and many Halfling clans can trace their ancestry back many centuries to the very founding of the Mootland (their self-governed Grand Province in the Empire). The Elder of the Moot — currently Hisme Stoutheart — is the custodian of the <em>Haffenlyver</em> , an ancient embroidered scroll detailing the chief bloodlines of their primary clans, said to be the greatest treasure of the Halflings. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/messenger.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"430\" /></div>\n<p>Another peculiar detail is the Halflings’ strange affinity for Ogres. Despite their ravenous appetites, and penchant for eating whatever is at hand, Ogres tend to respect Halflings. Indeed, gangs of Ogre labourers are often overseen by Halfling gaffers, and most Ogre mercenary bands have a Halfling cook on staff.</p>\n<p>Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children, and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this impression. They are known for their enormous appetites in all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they’re huggers), social boundaries (‘Well me’ great aunt’s just shacked up with me best mate, and you should hear what they’ve been up to!’), and property rights (‘It’s not like he’s using it!’); this last has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery. </p>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p>On Reiklander Humans…</p>\n<p><em>‘Stiff-necked and pious, warlike and jealous… I could go on, but good manners halts me, and, besides, I like them, and they like me pies. As long as you keep away from their temples and the hard-liners, they’re an open and pretty welcoming bunch. Good folk, and good for business.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Tubs’ Samworth Rumster XVI, Pie-seller from Kalegan</p>\n<p><strong>On Dwarfs…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘My aunt Bessi was the greediest, as were six of her sons. But Bessi has nothing on them Dwarfs. Eyes grow as big as Mannslieb at even a scratch of gold. But, if you tell them that, they’ll growl at you like you’ve taken the last honeycake, and start scribbling notes in one of their damned books about insulting their family honour or whatnot.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Lilly’ Joseppinalina Hayfoot, Pedlar in the Reikland</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I’ve seen them on the rivers in their white ships. How do they keep them so clean? And their hair… oh, their hair… it’s like sunshine, it is. Snuck on a boat once to see what they do. Same as the rest of us, it seems, just more... earnestly.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Dainty’ Cordelineth Brandysnap IV, Thief from Altdorf</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Elves living in the woods? Don’t be bloody ridiculous. Elves live in white towers and pretty boats over in Altdorf-town, you idiot.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Jammy’ Mercimaus Alderflower II, Scholar from Fielbach</p>\n<h3>High Elves</h3>\n<p>High Elves are a relatively common sight on the rivers of Reikland. Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg to the sea. These merchants are by far the most numerous of the High Elves found in Reikland, alongside diplomatic entourages and support staff. Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate, emotional folk widely perceived in the Reikland to be the most beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant.</p>\n<p>Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion among Humans who interact with them. </p>\n<p>The High Elves, who call themselves ‘Asur’, are native to Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World. A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the world’s civilisations. High Elves show considerable disdain for Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict. Since their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the ‘kinstrife’, although this isn’t something they discuss openly with outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, and ruthless. </p>\n<p>High Elven society is tightly-bound by ritual and discipline, intended to keep soaring emotions in check and provide focus for their complicated intellects. Seeming contrary to this, some Asur revel in wild adventure. The term ‘Sea Elf ’ is often used by other species to describe the dauntless High Elves who venture beyond Ulthuan’s safe shores as mariners, traders, and diplomats, and who stand in stark contrast to any grim Asur accompanying them who follow warrior lifestyles.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/envoy.webp\" width=\"259\" height=\"449\" /></div>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Reiklander Humans…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived hungers. But, when mindful of their petty needs and their fear of what we represent, they are easily shaped.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Imryth Emberfell, Ambassador from Caledor</p>\n<p><strong>On Dwarfs…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I suggest avoiding them. They are lost in the past, which blinds them to what’s coming. Nod politely, accept the abuse, and move on. There is no point arguing, they will never change their minds.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Alathan Crestrider, Seaman from Cothique</p>\n<p><strong>On Halflings…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I find these cheerful creatures genuinely interesting. I lived amongst an extended family group for a while, and found them so open, welcoming, and nurturing it was authentically touching. But, eventually, I had to move on, the smell was simply over-powering, and they have no understanding of personal space, which soon loses its charm.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Hoelistor Arceye, Wizard from Saphery</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘If the Asrai would bother to look beyond their dirty noses, they would see what we are all up against. Isolationist idiots that deserve everything that’s coming to them. I doubt the Eonir are any better.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Anaw-Alina Darkstep, Scout from Nagarythe</p>\n<h3>Wood Elves</h3>\n<p>Wood Elves are a rare sight in the Reikland, and for good reason. During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving ‘Wood Elves’ culturally very different to their High Elf cousins. </p>\n<p>Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed with spirits of the forest. They are separatists who work hard to hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed with powerful illusions and misleading magics. On the rare occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other peoples of the Old World deeply unsure of the fae, capricious Elves.</p>\n<p>There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The ‘Asrai’ from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland.</p>\n<p>The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive, and rarely venture beyond their borders. However, a decade ago, Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren. In response, the King and Queen of the Wood, recognising the fate of their forests may lay in the hands of outsiders, sent tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting the enemies of the forest at the source. </p>\n<p>These ferocious bands are sometimes led by a spellsinger who calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos. Occasionally, these wild hunters perceive some common cause with other Old Worlders and an individual may step from the shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the Queen of the Laurelorn takes a very different path to the foretellings given to her and has recently sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the Amber Hills just south of Altdorf. These Elves observe Human politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally intervene on matters deemed important. The camp is viewed as a ‘temporary’ solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word is very different to the long-lived species. Because of this camp, these Wood Elves are a growing presence in Reikland as they venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable purposes, often as hunters or entertainers.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/hunter.webp\" width=\"348\" height=\"507\" /></div>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Reiklander Humans…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a complete disrespect for order.

The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p><h4>Determining Characteristics</h4><p>When determining your Characteristics: </p><p><strong>Step 1) </strong>Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step.

If not, move to the next step.</p><p><strong>Step 3) </strong>If you’re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet.

effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is the weapon!</p><h4>Ballistic Skill (BS)</h4><p>Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.</p><h4>Strength (S)</h4><p>How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.</p><h4>Toughness (T)</h4><p>Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and standing up to poison.</p><h4>Initiative (I)</h4><p>Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of intuition and perception.</p><h4>Agility (Ag)</h4><p>Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for dodging blows in combat.</p><h4>Dexterity (Dex)</h4><p>Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.</p><h4>Intelligence (Int)</h4><p>Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the understanding and casting of magical spells.</p><h4>Willpower (WP)</h4><p>General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.</p><h4>Fellowship (Fel)</h4><p>Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with your deity.</p><h4>Characteristic Bonuses</h4><p>The first or ‘tens’ digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways throughout the rules, particularly for limiting Talents and defining Spells. </p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3. Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5</em>.</p><h3>Wounds (W)</h3><p>Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See  Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage.</p><h4>Determining Wounds</h4><p>Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus,, and Willpower Bonus (abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses used to calculate your Wounds. Note: Halflings have the Small Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}).</p><h3>Fate &amp; Fortune, Resilience &amp; Resolve</h3><p>Your Fate represents your destiny, and is directly tied to your Fortune, a measure of your luck. Your Resilience is your inner strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your grit. Your Resilience also comes with a Motivation, which is a single word or phrase describing what drives your character forwards. See @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.pa22HaRw1OBBQaDg]{Fate &amp; Resilience} for more on all of these.</p><h4>Determining Fate and Resilience</h4><p>You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are. By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through any situation.</p><h4>Determining Fortune and Resolve</h4><p>Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate. Your initial Resolve equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.</p><h4>Determining Motivation</h4><p>All characters choose a Motivation. It represents your Character’s core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for. In addition to the obvious roleplaying benefits for portraying your character, Motivation is used to help you regain Resolve points. When considering your Motivation, think of something that is fundamental to your character’s nature. Also try to make your Motivation something fun to roleplay, and something that will work well with the other PCs and their motivations.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf, has ‘Thrillseeker’ for his Motivation. He lives his life in pursuit of excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers. </em></p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has ‘Protect the weak’ as her Motivation. She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts, risking life and limb to save the Reikland’s citizenry. Clotilda will regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in harm’s way to protect another.</em></p><p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Ebba is a ‘Rebellious’ apprentice wizard studying at the Light College. She loves to break the rules of the College, flaunting her master’s authority, and poking her nose into books best left undisturbed. She regains Resolve whenever she breaks the rules set for her by superiors.</em></p><p>Other examples of potential motivations include: a ‘Perfectionist’, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy from flawless execution of schemes; a ‘Nurturer’, who gains strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult situations; a ‘Penitent Martyr’, who revels in hardship to atone for past misdeeds; or a ‘Shining Wit’, who’s ever engaging in witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood. If you can’t think of a Motivation don’t worry. One may arise as you create more of your character, and the other players and the GM can always help. Even if you do have one, it’s possible you may change your mind later. @UUID[.qBchGIhdjGocmbjU]{Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life} is a good time to reconsider what your Motivation will be.</p><h4>Movement (M)</h4><p>Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed. Standard Human Movement is 4. If using a grid for movement this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or inches across the table top. Over the longer term it indicates how many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot. For more on Movement, see @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc]{Moving}</p><table style=\"height:85px;width:40.3013%\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Movement</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Walk</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Run</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Advance Characteristics</h3><p>Upon selecting a career as \"Current\", you will see small \"plus\" symbols appear next to certain characteristics.

Enter these advances in manually, as clicking the plus symbols to advance will spend experience.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Characteristic Advances</em></h3><p><em>Characteristic Advances show training or experience in your Characteristics. The number of Advances you have in the Characteristic is added to the initial Characteristic to show your current ability.

        "content": "<p>Skills represent areas of trained learning or experience, and Talents describe special abilities your Character can access. A list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. The Skills and Talents you have available to you at character generation are determined by your Species and Career.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/it-wasnt-me.webp\" width=\"205\" height=\"267\" /></div><p>When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you gain in the Advances box of the Skill. If you should learn this skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a new number of Advances. If you learn a Talent, record it in your Talent list on your Character Sheet.</p><p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>. Basic Skills represent common abilities that everyone can perform — you can use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal to the governing characteristic. Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, and you can only use these skills if you have taken at least one Advance in them.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Some Talents can be learned multiple times. If you have an opportunity to learn a Talent a second time, check the talent on your character sheet to see if it can be learned multiple times, and mark how many times you’ve learned it on your Character Sheet.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>What Are Skill Advances?</em></h3><p><em>Like Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances show specific training in a Skill. All Skills are associated with a Characteristic, and the number of Advances you have in the Skill is added to that Characteristic to show you how skilled you are. So, as Climb is associated with Strength, if you have a Strength of 38, and 8 Climb Advances, your Climb Skill is 46.</em></p></blockquote><p>Each Species has a variety of Skills and Talents to choose from. You may choose 3 Skills to gain 5 Advances each, and 3 Skills to gain 3 Advances each. If a Talent listing presents a choice, you select one Talent from the choices given. Any Random Talents are determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you already have, you may reroll. <strong>Note</strong>: All Characters are assumed to be fluent in Reikspiel, the language of the Empire, and do not need to take it as a Skill.</p><h4>@UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.l0f11ypRjH9sR48Q#humans-(reiklander)]{Humans (Reiklander)}</h4><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Animal Care, Charm, Cool, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Language (Bretonnian), Language (Wastelander), Leadership, Lore (Reikland), Melee (Basic), Ranged (Bow)</p><p><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.QsrXxGZiHjth7RMg]{Savvy} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}, @Table[talents]{3 Random Talents}</p><h4>@UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.l0f11ypRjH9sR48Q#dwarfs]{Dwarfs}</h4><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Consume Alcohol, Cool, Endurance, Entertain (Storytelling), Evaluate, Intimidate, Language (Khazalid), Lore (Dwarfs), Lore (Geology), Lore (Metallurgy), Melee (Basic), Trade (any one)</p><p><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.eowbsW6oHGSNJmxV]{Magic Resistance}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.SgjJMBgc85aswvhm]{Relentless}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.uRvOg8AnCcP2ufx8]{Resolute} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Ywo6fZNPC4zbHHSQ]{Strong-minded}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.qZ4cFy6z482ZONuA]{Sturdy}</p><h4>@UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.l0f11ypRjH9sR48Q#halflings]{Halflings}</h4><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Charm, Consume Alcohol, Dodge, Gamble, Haggle, Intuition, Language (Mootish), Lore (Reikland), Perception, Sleight of Hand, Stealth (Any), Trade (Cook)</p><p><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.9h82z72XGo9tfgQS]{Acute Sense (Taste)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.vMYEkrWj0ip6ZOdv]{Resistance (Chaos)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.eBwHnWdwQJ590ASb]{Small}, @Table[talents]{2 Random Talents}</p><h4>@UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.l0f11ypRjH9sR48Q#high-elves]{High Elves}</h4><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Cool, Entertain (Sing), Evaluate, Language (Eltharin), Leadership, Melee (Basic), Navigation, Perception, Play (any one), Ranged (Bow), Sail, Swim</p><p><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.9h82z72XGo9tfgQS]{Acute Sense (Sight)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.JLzJws09GMw9GWBV]{Coolheaded} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.QsrXxGZiHjth7RMg]{Savvy}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.mNoCuaVbFBflfO6X]{Sixth Sense}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write}</p><h4>@UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.l0f11ypRjH9sR48Q#wood-elves]{Wood Elves}</h4><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Athletics, Climb, Endurance, Entertain (Sing), Intimidate, Language (Eltharin), Melee (Basic), Outdoor Survival, Perception, Ranged (Bow), Stealth (Rural), Track</p><p><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.9h82z72XGo9tfgQS]{Acute Sense (Sight)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.zImcTgEl2XNnbu5W]{Hardy} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.RmY0CUjiFYZ3GEKY]{Very Resilient}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.q58lK4kULJZB5GjE]{Rover}</p><h3>Career Skills and Talents</h3><p>You begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path.

You may also choose a single Talent to learn.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Lindsay is creating a Human Noble Scion, which has the following Career Skills: Bribery, Consume Alcohol, Gamble, Intimidate, Leadership, Lore (Heraldry), Melee (Fencing), Play (Any). She decides the character is well-schooled, but naive, so chooses to ignore the Bribery, Consume Alcohol, and Gamble Skills for the moment, and spreads her 40 Advances like so: Intimidate +7, Leadership +10, Lore (Heraldry) +10, Melee (Fencing) +3, and Play (Harpsichord) +10. Note: Lindsay can do this even if she has already allocated Advances to Leadership for being Human, as the limit of 10 Advances to a single Skill applies only during this allocation of 40 Advances.</em></p>",

Forenames include:</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev, Erika, Frauke, Frederich, Gerner, Gertraud, Haletha, Heinrich, Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke, Sebastien, Sigfreda, Talther, Talunda, Ulrich, Ulrika, Werther, Willelma, Wilryn.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Human Names And Their Origins</em></h3><p><em>Human names in WFRP are often taken from the real world, making it easy to research fun names online. The Reikland and much of The Empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are loosely medieval French.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Names are generated as part of the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">/char</span> command, alternatively you can use the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">/name</span> command</p></blockquote><p>In the Reikland, Human family surnames passed on from one generation to the next are most common in cities and towns, while in villages Humans are more likely to take on an individual surname when they reach adulthood. It’s common to take a surname from where you were born, such as ‘Wilhelm of Auerswald’. The nobility often have two surnames, one is the name of their House and the other is preceded by ‘von’ to indicate where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely.</p><p>The most common surnames are derived from your occupation, or the occupation of a parent or grandparent. Examples include: Bauer (Farmer), Fleischer (Butcher), Schmidt (Smith), and Schuster (Cobbler). If a character has a particularly noticeable physical trait, this might be used as a surname. This can often be passed down from parents to children too, which can become confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a short person claiming to be Lang (Tall). Some other examples include: Augenlos (one eye), Dunn (very thin), Laut (loud voice), Stark (Strong).</p><h4>Dwarf Names</h4><p>Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan name.</p><p><strong>Dwarf Forenames</strong></p><p>Dwarf names tend to be short and sturdy like the people they represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important ancestors, although individual clan traditions vary. Another common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun, Snorri.</p><p><strong>Khazalid examples</strong>: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard), Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril (Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)</p><p><strong>Dwarf Surnames</strong></p><p>Dwarf surnames are based on who raised the Dwarf, with the following suffixes the most common in use: </p><ul><li><p><strong>sdottir</strong>: Daughter of…</p></li><li><p><strong>snev</strong>: Nephew of…</p></li><li><p><strong>sniz</strong>: Niece of…</p></li><li><p><strong>sson</strong>: Son of…</p></li></ul><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz</p><p>It’s common as Dwarfs age and accrue deeds to their names to adopt a nickname based on physical appearance, prowess, or deed. These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it’s considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn’t represent the true character of a Dwarf. If such a nickname is adopted, it usually replaces the surname completely. So, Gerka Kardadottir would become Gerka Blackhand if she took the nickname ‘Blackhand’. Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but Dwarfs usually translate such to Reikspiel in order to better explain themselves.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid, Redhammer, Stonefist</p><h4>Clan Name</h4><p>Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not abandoned Dwarf tradition, which some Dwarfs living in the Empire have, especially rogue engineers). The Clan Name is always derived from the ancestor who founded the Clan, and is often sourced in a Nickname, often expressed in Khazalid. In practice, Dwarfs rarely use their Clan Name outside Dwarf society.</p><p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani, Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki</p><p><strong>Common Grey Mountain Clans</strong>: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger, Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk</p><h4>Elf Names</h4><p>Elves normally only admit to having names comprising of a forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland.</p><p><strong>Elf Forenames</strong></p><p>The Elves use a naming system quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Eltharin (the common language of High Elves and Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on more than simple syllables to convey meaning. The easiest way to create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator.</p><p><strong>Elf Epithets</strong></p><p>When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves with a forename and an epithet rather than attempt to explain the deeper concepts of Kindreds, Kinbands, or Houses. These epithets are always translated into Reikspiel as they are much easier for other species to pronounce and understand. Among High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical appearance, but can be more obscure. Wood Elf epithets typically reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin.</p><p><strong>High Elf examples</strong>: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart, Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign</p><p><strong>Wood Elf examples</strong>: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper, Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner</p><h4>Halfling Names</h4><p>Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees are not confused.</p><p><strong>Halfling Forenames</strong></p><p>Halflings proudly bear grand names drawn from their long family trees, but they rarely use these outside official business. Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of their ancestral name. Some Halfling’s diminutives are completely unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive, like Rosie or Scrumper. </p><p>Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer, Guv, or Nan. Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human names have now become ‘traditional’ Halfling names. </p><p><strong>Examples (with diminutives)</strong>: Antoniella (Anni), Esmerelda (Esme), Ferdinand (Fred), Heironymus (Hiro), Maximilian (Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)</p><p><strong>Halfling Clan Names</strong></p><p>Halfling clan names are almost exclusively related to food and drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics of the ancestor who first took the name. Halflings who have the same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly how. </p><p>Human’s tendency to have the same surname despite being unrelated causes confusion among some Halflings, who will happily pinch pies from a Schmidt on one street because a Schmidt on another street short-changed them. </p><p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot, Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble</p><h3>Physical Details</h3><p>When it comes to cosmetic physical details — those aspects of your appearance that don’t influence the game directly — you may either roll them randomly or choose from the range available to your Species. </p><h4>Age</h4><p>Average natural lifespans are around 60 for a Human, 120 for Halflings, and over 200 for a Dwarf, while Elves don’t appear to age at all and have been known to live for a thousand years or more. Choose your Character’s age or use the /char command.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Human</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Elf</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Halfling</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 15+d10 # Human Age]]</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 15 + 10d10 # Dwarf Age]]</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 30 + 10d10 # Elf Age]]</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 15 + 5d10 # Halfling Age]]</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While most species roll once on the table below, Elves may roll twice: their innately magical natures mean they often have variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut.</p><p>@Table[eyes]</p><h4>Hair Colour</h4><p>All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they move through middle age, then eventually turns white as they reach old age. </p><p>By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any signs of age. Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always.</p><p>@Table[hair]</p><h4>Height</h4><p>Average heights are: Dwarf (4’8”), Elf (6’5”), Halfling (3’6”), with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere around 5’9” in the Reikland. If you want a truly random upper height for Humans, if either die rolls a 10, roll one more die and add it to the height total.</p><table style=\"width:100%;height:34px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Human</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Elf</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Halfling</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">4'9\"+ [[/r 2d10 # Inches]]\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">4'3\"+ [[/r d10 # Inches]]\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">5'11\"+ [[/r d10 # Inches]]\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">3'1\"+ [[/r d10 # Inches]]\"</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ambitions</h3><p>Ambitions are a Character’s goals in life – what they want to achieve. All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term Ambition. </p><h4>Choosing Ambitions</h4><p>Consult with your GM when choosing your Ambitions. Your GM has final say on the acceptability of an Ambition, and whether it is short-term or long-term. Should you wish to change an Ambition, you may do so between sessions. </p><h4>Short-term Ambitions</h4><p>Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly sooner. Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition should take at least two or three sessions to complete.</p><p>Example short-term Ambitions include: </p><ul><li><p>Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival.</p></li><li><p>Avenging a fallen comrade.</p></li><li><p>Befriending a reclusive scholar. </p></li></ul><h4>Long-term Ambitions</h4><p>Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in your life than a realistic outcome.</p><p>Examples of long-term Ambitions include: </p><ul><li><p>Owning your own coaching inn.</p></li><li><p>Building your village into a thriving town.</p></li><li><p>Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence. </p></li></ul><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Nefarious Plans</em></h3><p><em>You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other players in your party, especially if they are controversial or clandestine. If you want to overthrow the Emperor, or legalise Necromancy in the Reikland, chances are your Witch Hunter ally won’t approve!</em></p></blockquote><h4>Achieving Your Ambitions</h4><p>If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the end of the session.  If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you may either:</p><ul><li><p>Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. </p></li><li><p>Retire your Character — who becomes an NPC under your GM’s control — and gain a bonus of half your earned XP of your current character to spend on your next character.</p></li></ul><p>Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a great source of adventure leads. </p>",

        "content": "<p>Fleshing out your Character’s personality and history will really help you bring them to life. Some players write detailed backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar with the Old World. Others prefer to just decide the basics at the start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the GM beforehand so you don’t derail any storylines). At the start of the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want to create, and we revisited that while creating Party ambitions. This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your Characters’ stories together and binding them into a tight-knit group with their own reasons for sticking together.</p><h3>Ten Questions</h3><p>One useful technique for creating an interesting background for your Character is to answer a series of questions about them — here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change something about the character you’ve created so far... do so! For instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may want to revisit the choices you made in @UUID[.f5Y4XenZVtDU2GUo]{4) Skills and Talents}. </p><h4>Where are you from?</h4><p>Do you come from one of Reikland’s bustling towns, or a sleepy village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead, or maybe you called the winding back alleys of Altdorf home? Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent threading the roads and riverways of Reikland, always on the move? See @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD]{Glorious Reikland} for details on the geography and settlements of this corner of the Empire.</p><h4>What is your family like?</h4><p>It may take a village to raise a child, but it’s your kin who do the heavy lifting. What were your parents’ occupations? Are they still alive? Do you have any siblings? Were you close, or were you constantly at one another’s throats? Grandparents? Nephews, nieces, cousins? Children, even? Does your family approve of your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on your family’s honour? </p><h4>What was your childhood like?</h4><p>Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself? Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member, a village school, or the local priest? Were you trained in the family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere or raised in an orphanage? </p><h4>Why did you leave home?</h4><p>Do you still live in your childhood home, or did you leave? If so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose in your life?</p><h4>Who are your best friends?</h4><p>While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another matter entirely, and you can tell a lot about someone by the friends they keep. Do you have any friends from childhood? Or friends you’ve made since leaving home? What do you do together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour of a loyal pet? </p><h4>What is your greatest desire?</h4><p>What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal. If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be? </p><h4>What are your best and worst memories?</h4><p>We are the sum of our experiences; they shape and mould us, forging us anew. What are your most treasured memories? An afternoon of glorious summer sunshine? A passionate kiss, while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred, disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?</p><h4>What are your religious beliefs?</h4><p>Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration is a matter of course. That being said, not all of the gods are favoured equally. </p><p>Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle? See @UUID[JournalEntry.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon]{Religion and Belief} for details of the gods and their ways. </p><h4>To whom, or what, are you loyal?</h4><p>Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire… or just to yourself? </p><h4>Why are you adventuring?</h4><p>And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not just another citizen of the Empire. Why are you adventuring?</p><p>Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life thrust upon you, against your will. Are you seeking justice, or vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight to clear your name, or survive your enemies?</p><p>Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character, ready to go. But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus XP during the character creation process? If so, you may wish to spend it before you begin play.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Psychology</em></h3><p><em>When you are creating your Character’s story, you might feel you should have powerful emotions such as @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.jbQDTxc4QNZDLaXm]{Love}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.EBmSCscpk4vEDCD3]{Camaraderie}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.E98mVLZgE8bX5vQW]{Hatred} etc towards family members, situations, enemies or other features of their life.
